# Assigment_03

Implement the K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis algorithms from scratch in Python using Numpy and Pandas and Matplotlib for visualization.
The algorithm must be implemented as a function with arguments (dataset).
<b> The last column, Species needs to be removed before giving it as argument to the function. The column needs to stored in another variable for future comparison.
For Principal Component Analysis, the data (without Species column) must be plotted in the first three eigenvectors and the eigenvalues for the corresponding values should also be noted. 
In clustering, two plots one showing the output of the cluster and one showing actual species should be displayed. </b>
